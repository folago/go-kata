# Go kata 

Hello, welcome to the Go kata

Today we are getting our hands dirty with in Go

But before that let's introduce  the Go programming language

---

# Why Go?

**Slow builds and complexity**

Some engineers at Google were bored during C++ builds and started talking

And asked themselves: Can we do better?

---

# Go inception

The initial instigators were:
- Ken Thompson
- Rob Pike
- Robert Grisemer

Which gives Go a nice pedigree...

... and a strong C heritage

---

# Improvements over C

- compiled and statically linked
- garbage collected
- built-in concurrency 
- batteries included
- basic generic types *map*, *slice*, and *channel*
- simple and orthogonal

---

## Compiled and statically linked

VMs and interpreters are a dependency 

And different lib version on different machines can cause issues

---
##  Garbage collected

Development speed 

Memory safety

---
## Built-in concurrency 

How many cores do you have on your laptop?
On your phone?
  
Also remove the library explosion

---

## Batteries included

Rich STD lib 

Build and test framework

Cross compiling

---
## Basic generic types

*map*, *slices*, and *channels*

Since Go 1.18 with more generics

---

## Simple and orthogonal

Composition over inheritance 

Structural typing via interfaces 

Simple type system

---

# Trendsetting 

Standard code formatting 

Language idioms

Errors as values
